        "answer": "We will be at your door at the agreed time, fully equipped with all necessary cleaning equipment for a comprehensive cleaning session in your home or office.

The choice is entirely up to you. Rest assured that regardless of your preferences, we are dedicated to delivering first-class cleaning service that meets your expectations."

      {
        "id": "9",
        "question": "What is the price for cleaning service?",
        "answer": "The price always depends on the size of the building, carpet size, pets, and whether you need us to clean extra items. Our hourly rate is 195 DKK + VAT.

        "id": "10",
        "question": "How can I save money with the service deduction?",
        "answer": "If you hire private cleaning services, you can potentially save significantly on your cleaning expenses.\n\nThe recent increase in the cleaning deduction brings significant changes and offers an impressive 26% reduction in cleaning costs. From January 2024, this deduction increases to 11,900 DKK per year for each person over 18 years old living at the address.\n\nFor example, if your living area is 70 square meters, a standard cleaning service might cost you 390 DKK (incl. VAT). But with the deduction in play, that price drops to just 288.6 DKK (incl. VAT).\n\nThis can provide significant savings for you while maintaining a sparkling clean living environment.\n\nRead more about the deduction here: https://skat.dk/borger/fradrag/servicefradrag/servicefradrag"
      },
      {
        "id": "11",

        "answer": "Regular cleaning:\n- Washing and drying surfaces in the home\n- Cleaning toilets and bathrooms\n- Vacuuming, mopping, and cleaning\n- Dishwashing, laundry, and ironing\n- Cleaning or washing carpets, curtains, blinds, etc."
      },
      {
        "id": "12",
        "question": "Who can get the service deduction?",
        "answer": "Whether you own or rent your home, you are eligible for this deduction. All you need is to be registered in the national register at the specific address and be at least 18 years old. Additionally, you don't need to oversee or approve the cleaning process. By choosing a certified cleaning service like renklar.dk, any administrative burdens or need for paperwork are removed. If you share your home with others, such as fellow students in a shared living arrangement, you can easily split the deduction between you. Simply make the payment electronically to ensure proper documentation; cash payment is not eligible. It's crucial that all co-residents are officially registered residents at the address to qualify."

We will arrange a follow-up visit as soon as possible to address any areas that didn't meet your expectations. This follow-up cleaning service is offered at no extra cost."
      },
      {
        "id": "16",

If you have continuous service from us, we send you the invoice after each cleaning in the first month, and then we send invoices once a month. You can pay by bank transfer. We do not accept cash."
